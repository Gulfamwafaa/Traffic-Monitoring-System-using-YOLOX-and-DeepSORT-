# Traffic Monitoring System using YOLOX and DeepSORT

# Note: 
The reason I don't deploy this repository to Heroku because it's very heavy, runs 1-2 FPS with CPU. So I used ngrok to be able to deploy online and used Colab to take advantage of the GPU. However, run it if you have a powerful enough GPU (Colab's GPU runs around 8-14 FPS, quite slow but better than CPU)
